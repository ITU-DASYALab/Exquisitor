# Tests

## ExqDataHandlerR64-test.cpp

This file tests the ExqDataHandlerR64 class. 
It loads the Ratio-i64 dataset and verifies that the loaded data is correct.


### Important Note
Copy the data folder into the cmake-build-debug/test folder to run tests for now. 
Future version of the CMakeLists.txt will remove this requirement.
